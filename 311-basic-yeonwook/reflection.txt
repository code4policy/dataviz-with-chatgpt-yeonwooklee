Creating charts using codes of JavaScript file with the help of ChatGPT was magical. But there is no magic. In the end, the instructions I want are contained in the code. I have found that the more specific I ask questions, explaining what I want, the better answers I get from ChatCPT. The same applies when there are supplements. I need to ask myself what exactly I want to change and how to change it. It is also important to read carefully which parts of the code are there, ask where they are, and change the code one by one to observe changes. Randomly asking for full code makes fine tuning impossible and it takes a long time to get closer to what you want.

As I explored the data, I once again realized the usefulness of the functions I was learning. I created a bar chart for "Top 10 Reasons for 311 Calls," but the data contained in the csv file was actually extensive. In Excel, it took quite a while to run and edit. It included the title, subject, reason, type, department, etc. of each case. The ability to instantly analyze raw data and create charts may not be magic, but it was truly amazing to me.
